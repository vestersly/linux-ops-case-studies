## Reproduction Steps (Controlled CPU Pressure)

The following steps describe how CPU pressure was intentionally generated
to observe service degradation behavior under sustained load.

> ⚠️ Execute these steps only in a test or lab environment.

### Step 1: Verify baseline CPU state

Confirm the system is healthy and mostly idle before inducing load:

```bash
uptime
